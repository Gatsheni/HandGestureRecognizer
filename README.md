# HandGestureRecognizer
This is my first attempt at a Convolutional Neural Network that classifies 25 different hand gestures.
The model was built using PyTorch on Google Colab.
The training dataset was a large csv file with pixel values of over 7 thousand different images along with the class they each belong to.
The test data has 7172 image pixel values and of coures no labels as this is the task of the classifier to assign. 
The model saved state was 99% validation accuracy and 91% training accuracy. A little tweaking of hyper parameters could probably get an
even better result.
The training data is too large to upload on GitHub so I provided the test data and the results.
